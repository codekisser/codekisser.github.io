The best thing about working from home is that I can walk around completely naked and this saves me so much time by not having to get dressed or do laundry. The Opposition will try to convince you that wearing clothes is beneficial, but the facts don't lie. Those 15 seconds I save not having to unzip my trousers when going to the bathroom allows me to surpass my competitors.

## Drawbacks

My sister often sees me walking around the house like this and I often have to remind her that it is not an invitation for intercourse.

Additionally, sitting at my computer all day gets me a little sweaty, and my body oils seep into my leather chair over time, creating stains with a sharp aroma. Unfortunately, every once in a while, I have to clean my chair which partially negates the time I saved that I mentioned earlier. A possible time save is to only wash your chair once every 6 months, when the stench only starts to get really viscous.
