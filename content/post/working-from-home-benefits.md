The best thing about working from home is that I can walk around completely naked and this makes it very easy to go to the bathroom.
The Opposition will try to convince you that wearing clothes is beneficial, but the facts don't lie. Those 15 seconds I save not having to unzip my trousers allows me to surpass my competitors. 

My sister often sees me walking around the house like this and I often have to remind her that it is not an invitation for intercourse.
